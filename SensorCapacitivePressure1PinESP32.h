// A capacitive pressure sensor made of two plates of conductive foil with an insulating material between them forming a capacitor
// When pressure is applied the capacitance increases
// This implementation measures the time to charge the capacitor to a "HIGH" level, this value is in a linear relationship to the capacitance
// Similar implementations: http://wordpress.codewrite.co.uk/pic/2014/01/25/capacitance-meter-mk-ii/, http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/CapacitiveSensor
// This implementation uses only one pin of the microcontroller. The capacitor bottom plate is conencted to ground
// When taking a measurement, the capacitor top plate is sensed through a digital pin while at the same time the same pin charges it through a built-in PULLUP resistor (~40K ohm)
// To discharge, the PULLDOWN feature of the ESP32 is used
