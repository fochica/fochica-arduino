// This class monitors a calibrated sensor of battery voltage and sends a HIGH signal on some been as long as we want to keep using power.
// Once the monitor detects that the voltage is in "low state" it stops emitting the "keep-live" signal causing the discharge protection circuit to stop power to the device.
// If battery voltage sensing circuit is not working, this can cause us to shutdown when there is no need to.
// If the discharge protection circuit is not working, this can cause us to keep running even though we are in what seems to be a "low state".
